        My Story

    <p class="story">
        Inspired by my mother who has a passion for cooking but also, a comical inability to stay organized. As it was time for me to move away from home, I hated the thought of leaving my mother’s homecooked meals or worse... leaving her to do the shopping.
        I created this application so we could share our recipes, and I could ensure she doesn’t starve without a structured way to plan meals and shop
